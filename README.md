# Classification_Clothing_using_CNN
This model will predict the probability of the type of Clothing/accessory while using a Convolutional Neural N/w (CNN).
Using only softmax layer & renu, maxpooling and padding, this leads to a better result in accuracy & loss function.

# CNN
Let's first understand what CNN stands for and what it means. CNN stands for Concolutional neural network. Now, you wonder
how machines come to learn & understand without us having to tell them each & every time what to so. we give them BRAINS.
Yes! That's how it works. The neural network is like the neuron system in our brain. It send electrical synapses from one
neuron to another then again from this one to that one, ultimately culiminating in a single action or decision. that is how
we program these machines to do. 
it's like raising a toddler. you teach them to read the alphabets 7 years later they can understand words & read sentences 
and further years ahead, you see them writing essays and stories.
